            A sumptuous, addictive story of ambition and love from YA fantasy sensation Tricia Levenseller 
            <br />
            <br />
            'A wicked fun romp with corsets and jewelled daggers' Emily R. King, author of The Hundredth Queen Series 
            <br />
            <br />
            No one knows the extent of the freshly crowned Shadow King's power.
            Some say he can command the shadows that swirl around him to do his bidding. 
            <br />
            Others say they speak to him, whispering the thoughts of his enemies.
            Regardless, Alessandra, tired of being overlooked, has a plan to gain power: woo the Shadow King, marry him, then kill him and
            take his kingdom for herself. 
            <br />
            <br />
            But Alessandra's not the only one trying to kill the king.
            As he dodges assassination attempts, she finds herself trying to keep him alive long enough for him to make her his queen - 
            all while struggling not to lose her heart. 
            <br />
            <br />
            After all, who better for a Shadow King than a cunning, villainous queen?
