            From the bestselling author of The Night Circus, a timeless love story set in a secret underground world—a place of pirates, 
            painters, lovers, liars, and ships that sail upon a starless sea. <br />
            <br />
            Zachary Ezra Rawlins is a graduate student in Vermont when he discovers a mysterious book hidden in the stacks. 
            As he turns the pages, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, key collectors, and nameless acolytes, he reads something strange: a story 
            from his own childhood.
            <br />
            <br />
            Bewildered by this inexplicable book and desperate to make sense of how his own life came to be recorded, Zachary uncovers a series of clues—a bee, 
            a key, and a <br />sword—that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, to a secret club, and through a doorway to an ancient library hidden far 
            below the surface of the earth. <br />
            What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians—it is a place of lost cities and seas, 
            lovers who pass notes under <br />doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. 
            Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their <br />tongues to preserve this archive, 
            and also of those who are intent on its destruction.
            <br />
            <br />
            Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a handsome, 
            barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, <br />darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, 
            and sweetly soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose—in both the mysterious book and in his own life.
